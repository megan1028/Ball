# Ball
CUDA

implement the 2D bouncing balls simulation using CUDA. Specifically do the following:
• Develop the CUDA kernel by properly modifying your computation thread so that the required computation is done by a large number (hundreds) of
concurrent threads.
• Develop the CUDA host program by appropriately modifying the control thread.
• Implement the required OpenGL calls within your CUDA program appropriately.
• Optimize your CUDA program to minimize/avoid synchronization as much as possible.
